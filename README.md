# Cline Helper: Supercharge Your Vibe Coding

Tired of manually copying and pasting file paths for your vibe coding sessions with tools like Cline or Roo Code? Cline Helper is here to streamline your workflow!

This VS Code extension provides a simple and powerful interface to quickly collect, search, and manage file and folder paths, making it incredibly fast and efficient to build the context you need for your AI coding assistant.

## Getting Started

1.  Find the **Cline Helper** icon (`$(list-unordered)`) in your VS Code activity bar.
2.  Click it to open the sidebar.

That's it! You're ready to go.

## Core Features

Cline Helper is organized into three powerful tabs:

### 1. Collector Tab

Your central hub for gathering file paths.

*   **Collect Paths**: Drag and drop files or folders into the panel to create a custom list of paths.
*   **List Folder Contents**: Drop a folder to recursively list every file inside it. Perfect for grabbing an entire component or module for context.

### 2. Searcher Tab

Quickly find any file or folder in your workspace with a real-time search. It even highlights related files that are outside the main folder you're looking at.

### 3. Open Files Tab

Instantly get a list of all the files you currently have open in your editor. Great for when you need to share the context of your current working set.

## Customization

Click the **Settings** icon (`$(gear)`) to:
*   Toggle between full and relative paths.
*   Add custom prefixes to your file paths (e.g., `@/`).
*   Set up `.gitignore`-style filters to exclude unwanted files and folders from your results.

Spend less time gathering context and more time coding. Happy vibing!
